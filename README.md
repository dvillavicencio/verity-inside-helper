# Verity Helper (Inside)

Is about time someone made a web application about how to do the inside portion of the Verity encounter.

In all seriousness though, the reason I created this project is because I mainly like to help LFG fireteams and there's still a lot of people that do not know how to solve the encounter both on the inside and the outside portion, and I have sat for hours on end trying to explain to a fellow guardian, something that I can only understand once they get their hands dirty. That's partially why I feel that is a good idea to also have a helper application for people trying to understand the general strategy for the inside portion of the encounter.
